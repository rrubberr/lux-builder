LuxRender 1.9
=============
LuxRender is a physically based and unbiased rendering engine. Based on
state of the art algorithms, LuxRender simulates the flow of light
according to physical equations, thus producing realistic images of
photographic quality.

What's new in 1.9:
-----------------
 - The LuxRender build system has been updated to support native
   compilation on modern Linux distributions, using GCC 15+
   and CMake 4.0+.

 - A new collapsing BVH accelerator using AVX2 will be compiled
   if host CPU support is detected. Set your accelerator to "BVH"
   in Blender. (Wald et al. 2008)

 - Misc. library updates include:
    - QT4 --> 6
    - Boost 1.44 --> 1.90
    - OpenImageIO 1.6.3 --> 3.1.12

What's included:
---------------
 - luxrender, luxconsole, luxmerger
   LuxRender GUI and console version, FLM merging tool.
 
 - liblux.so, pylux.so
   LuxRender shared library and Python binding modules for Blender
   2.79b integration.
 
 - examples
   Two example scenes for LuxRenderer which you can try right away:
   LuxTime (by freejack) and School Corridor (by B.Y.O.B.).

Notes:
-----
 - Please note that our official precompiled LuxRender builds are only
   compatible with official Blender builds from http://blender.org. If
   you are using a custom Blender build from your Linux distribution
   repository or a some alternative source, you should use a custom
   LuxRender build as well.

Compiling from source:
---------------------
 - To compile from source, you'll need to install Qt6 core, dbus,
   gui, imageformats, and widgets from your package manager.

 - You will also need fftw3, freetype, and common compression libraries
   like lzma and bzip2. These are likely present on your system already.

 - Then, run "sh makelux.sh" in the same folder as this README.
